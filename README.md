# Android Browser Helper

![CI Status Badge](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/android-browser-helper/workflows/Android%20CI/badge.svg)

The Android Browser Helper library helps developers use Custom Tabs and Trusted
Web Activities on top of the AndroidX browser support library.
It contains default implementations of many of the common tasks a
developer will find themselves requiring, for example:

* Creating a Launcher Activity that simply launches a Trusted Web Activity.
* Code for choosing an appropriate Custom Tabs provider.
* Creating an Activity to launch the browser's site settings for a TWA.

## Adding Android Browser Helper to an Android project

Android Browser helper is available on the Google Maven. To use it, modify your application's
`build.gradle` and add the library as a dependency, as described below:

```gradle
dependencies {
    //...
    implementation 'com.google.androidbrowserhelper:androidbrowserhelper:1.3.2'
}

```
